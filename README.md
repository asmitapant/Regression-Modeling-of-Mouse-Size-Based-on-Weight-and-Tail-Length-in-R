# Regression-Modeling-of-Mouse-Size-Based-on-Weight-and-Tail-Length-in-R
This R project explores linear relationships between mouse body size and two physical attributes: weight and tail length. Using both simple and multiple regression models, the script estimates how well these predictors explain variations in size. Visualizations are included to support interpretation of model fit and trends.
This example illustrates the impact of including multiple predictors in a regression model and how visual tools support statistical interpretation. It's a strong building block for more complex data science tasks, and shows mastery in R coding, plotting, and statistical modeling.
