# Regression-Modeling-of-Mouse-Size-Based-on-Weight-and-Tail-Length-in-R
This R project explores linear relationships between mouse body size and two physical attributes: weight and tail length. Using both simple and multiple regression models, the script estimates how well these predictors explain variations in size. Visualizations are included to support interpretation of model fit and trends.
