# Regression-Modeling-of-Mouse-Size-Based-on-Weight-and-Tail-Length-in-R
This R project explores linear relationships between mouse body size and two physical attributes: weight and tail length. Using both simple and multiple regression models, the script estimates how well these predictors explain variations in size.
This example illustrates the impact of including multiple predictors in a regression model and how visual tools support statistical interpretation.
